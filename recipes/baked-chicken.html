    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      What I had to do to squeeze this recipe from my neighbor...but it's worth
      it. This is a scrumptious version of sticky chicken.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup prepared barbecue sauce</li>

      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>

      <li>¼ cup red wine</li>

      <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>

      <li>11 teaspoon onion powder</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

      <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup,
        chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin
        in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the
        sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to
        coat both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the
        juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees
        C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and
        bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl
        until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat
        to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return
        the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken
        to serve.
